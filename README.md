## Java Fundamentals in Android Bootcamp

#### Lessons Plans

Each session - day 1 morning/afternoon - has its own lesson plan and corresponding slides.  Each of the lesson plans can be found in the links below:

- [__Day 1, Morning__](01-day-one-morning.md)
- [__Day 1, Afternoon__](02-day-one-afternoon.md)

The [slides/](slides) directory includes all of the slides that are needed to run the Android Workshop; these slides use a presentation framework called [`reveal.js`](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). To use the slides, open the `slides/index.html` files in your browser.  The slides are written in HTML.

Within the slides, and session lesson, are links to the repositories with source code for examples and exercises to be done in class. You can also find links to repositories below:

#### Tech Dependencies

Students should come to this class with Java, Android Studio/SDK, and a text editor installed (Sublime or Atom will do just fine).

__Note:__ Do _not_ use VIM to demonstrate code examples. Use a text editor to modify and edit files. For this workshop, we encourage instructors to use the command line to execute Java files.
